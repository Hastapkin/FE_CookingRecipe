BÚN CHẢ

Ingredients
Pork belly (for grilling, with both lean and fat parts)

Ground pork (for pork patties)

Shallots and garlic

Fish sauce (recommended: high-quality "nước mắm cốt")

Sugar, pepper, oyster sauce

Vermicelli noodles (bún)

Mixed herbs (lettuce, perilla, peppermint, coriander)

Pickled green papaya and carrots

Dipping sauce ingredients: fish sauce, broth, sugar, garlic, chili, lime

Instructions
Prepare the Pork
Slice the pork belly thinly for grilling.

For the patties, season the ground pork with shallots, garlic, fish sauce, oyster sauce, and pepper.

Marinate both pork belly slices and ground pork for at least 1 hour for better flavor.

Shape the ground pork mixture into small round patties.

Grill the Meat
Use a charcoal grill for authentic flavor (preferable over an oven or air fryer).

Grill both the pork belly slices and patties until golden and slightly charred on the outside.

Make the Dipping Sauce
Mix fish sauce, a bit of broth, sugar, minced garlic, chopped chili, and lime. Adjust sweet, sour, salty flavors to your liking.

Add the pickled carrots and green papaya.

Assemble the Dish
Serve grilled meat and patties separately or together.

Add a portion of vermicelli noodles to a bowl, along with fresh herbs.

Pour some dipping sauce with pickles over, and dip the meat as you eat.

Notes
Using a charcoal grill gives the best taste, creating the signature smokiness of authentic bún chả.

Adjust the dipping sauce ingredients according to your taste.

Prioritize a good-quality fish sauce, as it determines the quality of the dish.
