Ingredients
Frog meat (field or farmed frog, cleaned, skinned, cut into pieces)

Turmeric (fresh, grated or ground)

Onion, garlic, chili

Salt, pepper

Cooking oil

Other optional spices: Fish sauce, oyster sauce, lemongrass

Instructions
Step 1: Prepare the Frog Meat
Clean and cut the frog into bite-sized pieces. Make sure to remove skin and inner organs.

Step 2: Marinate
In a bowl, combine frog pieces with turmeric, chopped onion, minced garlic, chili, salt, and pepper.

Optionally, add a dash of fish sauce or oyster sauce for extra flavor.

Mix well and leave to marinate for at least 20–30 minutes so the flavors penetrate the meat.

Step 3: Grill
Grill marinated frog pieces over charcoal for best results. If using an oven or grill pan, preheat to high.

Turn frequently, basting with remaining marinade or a little oil to keep moist.

Grill until the frog meat is cooked through, slightly charred, and very fragrant.

Step 4: Serve
Plate up the grilled frog, optionally topping with fresh herbs or more chili.

Eat hot, best enjoyed with rice or a dipping sauce as you like.

Notes
Charcoal grilling gives the frog meat its signature smoky aroma and flavor.

Turmeric not only adds color but also a slight earthy warmth, balancing the natural taste of the frog.

This method highlights the combination of turmeric, onion, and chili for a warm, balanced dish and emphasizes the importance of grilling over charcoal for maximum fragrance.
