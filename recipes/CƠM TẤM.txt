Ingredients
Broken rice (cooked as usual)

Pork chops (sườn cốt lết)

Pork skin and pork (for shredded pork skin, "bì")

Vietnamese steamed egg meatloaf ("chả trứng")

Pickled vegetables (carrot, daikon)

Cucumber, tomato, fresh herbs

Garlic, shallots, fish sauce, oyster sauce, sugar, pepper, honey, eggs, mung bean noodles, wood ear mushrooms

Signature sweet fish sauce for serving

Instructions
Step 1: Cook the Broken Rice
Rinse the broken rice several times and cook in a rice cooker.

For best texture, ensure the water ratio is just enough (about as high as your first knuckle on the submerged rice).

Step 2: Prepare and Grill Pork Chops
Tenderize and flatten pork chops.

Marinate pork with minced garlic, shallots, oyster sauce, honey, fish sauce, pepper, and sugar for at least 1 hour.

Grill the pork over charcoal until cooked, flavorful, and slightly caramelized.

Step 3: Make Shredded Pork Skin ("Bì")
Boil pork skin briefly, slice thinly.

Toss with julienned pork, toasted rice powder, garlic, and fish sauce to taste.

Step 4: Prepare Steamed Egg Meatloaf ("Chả Trứng")
Mix ground pork with mung bean noodles (soaked and chopped), wood ear mushrooms (soaked and diced), eggs, salt, pepper, and a small amount of shallot.

Spread the mixture in a plate, steam for 25-30 minutes.

Brush with a layer of egg yolk and steam 5 more minutes for a glossy finish.

Step 5: Sweet Fish Sauce
Make a sauce with fish sauce, sugar, water, vinegar (or lime juice), garlic, and chili.

Adjust to a balance of sweet, salty, sour, and spicy for the signature flavor.

Step 6: Assemble and Serve
Serve the broken rice on a plate with grilled pork chop, a slice of egg meatloaf, a portion of shredded pork skin, pickled vegetables, fresh cucumber, and herbs.

Drizzle with sweet fish sauce and enjoy.
