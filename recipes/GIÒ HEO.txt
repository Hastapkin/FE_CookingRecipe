Ingredients
Pork knuckle (pork hock or front leg), cleaned well

Salt, pepper, ginger (for cleaning/blanching)

Fish sauce (high quality)

Garlic, shallots, red chili, onion

Sugar

Cooking oil

Instructions
Step 1: Prepare the Pork Knuckle
Clean the pork knuckle with salt and ginger to remove odor; rinse well.

Optionally, blanch the knuckle in boiling water for a few minutes, then rinse with cold water.

Step 2: Boil and Dry
Boil the pork knuckle until just cooked through but not too soft (about 45–60 minutes).

Remove and submerge in ice water to tighten and crisp the skin.

Let it drain and dry thoroughly (even overnight in the fridge for extra crispiness).

Step 3: Deep-Fry
Heat a generous amount of oil in a large pot or wok.

Carefully fry the knuckle until the skin is golden brown and shatteringly crisp, turning as needed.

Remove and let excess oil drain.

Step 4: Fish Sauce Glaze
In a pan, brown chopped garlic, shallots, and chili in a bit of oil until fragrant.

Add fish sauce and sugar. Stir until slightly thickened into a glaze.

Toss the fried pork knuckle pieces in the sauce to fully coat.

Step 5: Serve
Chop the crispy knuckle into bite-sized pieces.

Serve immediately for maximum juiciness and crunch, with rice or as a party snack.

Notes
The key is thoroughly drying the pork skin before frying to achieve maximum crispiness and prevent oil splattering.​

The sweet-salty fish sauce glaze is what sets this dish apart and pairs perfectly with the rich meat.
