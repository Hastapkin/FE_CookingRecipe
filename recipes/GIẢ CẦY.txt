GIẢ CẦY

Ingredients
Pork trotters (ideally grilled with sugarcane residue for extra aroma)

Galangal root, lemongrass, garlic, shallots

Fermented rice ("mẻ"), shrimp paste ("mắm tôm"), turmeric or fresh turmeric

Fish sauce, salt, MSG, sugar, black pepper

Water or coconut water

Rice noodles (for serving)

Instructions
Step 1: Prepare the Pork Trotters
Clean the pork trotters well, then grill them lightly over an open flame (ideally with sugarcane residue) to give a smoky taste and aroma.

Cut the pork trotters into pieces.

Step 2: Marinate the Pork
In a large bowl, combine chopped galangal, crushed lemongrass, minced garlic and shallots, fermented rice, shrimp paste, turmeric, fish sauce, and a bit of salt, sugar, and pepper.

Add the pork pieces to the marinade and mix well.

Let marinate for 1–2 hours for best flavor.

Step 3: Sear and Stew
In a large pot, heat some oil and add the marinated pork. Sear until the pork changes color and the spices are fragrant.

Add enough water (or coconut water) to barely cover the pork.

Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 45 minutes to 1 hour, until the pork is tender and the sauce has thickened.

Step 4: Adjust and Serve
Taste and adjust seasoning if needed (more fish sauce, a bit more fermented rice, or extra galangal for aroma).

Serve hot with rice noodles or steamed rice. Garnish with fresh herbs if desired.

Notes
The dish is known for its aromatic flavor from galangal and its tangy sharpness from fermented rice.

Grilling the trotters before cooking adds a unique smoky taste that is key to "giả cầy".

This is a popular drinking dish in Vietnam, particularly on rainy days, and pairs well with rice noodles.
