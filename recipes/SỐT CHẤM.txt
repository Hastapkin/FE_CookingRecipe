1/2 tsp black pepper

1 tbsp lime juice

Tips
Both sauces can be stored in the fridge. The green chili sauce with milk should be kept cold and used within a week.

The lime pepper sauce is very versatile and quick to make—great for any barbecue or hotpot meal.

These two sauces cover most Vietnamese seafood and meat dishes, enhancing their flavor with a sweet, sour, spicy, and slightly creamy finish.
